Microfrontend Root-Config
-------------------------

Well, look at you, stumbling upon *another* mind-blowing microfrontend masterpiece. This here is the root configuration for a bunch of MFs (Microfrontends, of course). I'm using **Single SPA** to combine all these microfrontends into one place. So buckle up, because you're in for a real treat.

URL

If you're dying to see this in action, here you go:\
**[Root MF URL](https://hi-malay.github.io/mf-root-config/)**

Click "employees" on this bad boy and *poof*, you'll load a new microfrontend:\
**[Employees MF](https://hi-malay.github.io/mf-root-config/employees)**

Pretty magical, huh?

Installation
------------

Follow these incredibly complicated steps to get it running locally (if you dare):

1.  Clone the repo (you know the drill).

2.  Run:

    bash

    Copy code

    `npm install
    npm run start`

-   **[mf-employee-details](https://github.com/hi-malay/mf-employee-details)**: And here's a twist---this one's Angular. (Because who doesn't love mixing frameworks?)
